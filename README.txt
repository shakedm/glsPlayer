Instructions on running the script:
1) the project is deploy to netlify.
2) copy main.js to console (the function that loads the code is already called there).
3) after calling main.js you can use the variable 'guideRes' to access the player state and run the methods directly (for example 'guideRes.goNext()' to simulate a "Next" button click)
